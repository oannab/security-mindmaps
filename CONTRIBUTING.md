# 🤝 Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help. These maps are more useful when more eyes are on them.

## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Report an Error
Open an **Issue** with:
- Which file and which section/node
- What's wrong (factual error, typo, outdated info, broken formatting)
- What it should say (if you know)

### ✏️ Fix Something Yourself
1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes in the relevant `.md` file
3. Open a Pull Request with a short description of what you changed and why

### ➕ Add a New Map or Section
If you want to contribute a new domain map or a new topic area:
1. Open an Issue first to discuss scope — avoids duplicate work
2. Try to follow the existing colour-category system for consistency
3. If it's a CompTIA map, stick to the official exam objectives as the structure backbone

## Style Guide

- Use the 8-category colour system consistently (see README for the full table)
- Keep node text concise — one concept or one relationship per node
- Where helpful, add a "Role:" or "Used by:" line under a section header to give context
- Cross-references between related concepts are encouraged
