# 📖 How to Use These Maps

## What is Markmap?

Markmap converts Markdown into an interactive mind map. Nodes expand and collapse on click, you can zoom with your scroll wheel, and pan by dragging the canvas. It's entirely free and runs in a browser or VS Code.

## Method 1 — Browser (No Setup)

1. Open **[markmap.js.org/repl](https://markmap.js.org/repl)**
2. Select all the placeholder text on the left panel and delete it
3. Copy the full contents of any `.md` file from this repo (`Ctrl+A` → `Ctrl+C` after opening the raw file on GitHub)
4. Paste into the left panel
5. The map renders live on the right

**Getting the raw file from GitHub:**  
Open any `.md` file in this repo → click the **Raw** button (top right of the file view) → `Ctrl+A` to select all → `Ctrl+C` to copy.

## Method 2 — VS Code Extension (Best for Study)

### Install
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **Markmap** by `gera2ld`  
   Extension ID: `gera2ld.markmap-vscode`
4. Click Install

### Use
1. Open any `.md` file from this repo in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
3. Type `Markmap: Open as Markmap` and hit Enter
4. A live-updating map opens in a split panel

### Study workflow tip
- Put the map on the right panel (click and drag the tab)
- Open a blank `.md` for notes on the left
- As you study each node, write your own notes on the left in your own words
- The act of restating things builds retention faster than re-reading

## Colour System (Quick Reference)

Every node is colour-coded by category. Once you internalise this, you can scan a branch and immediately know what *type* each node is — hardware, software, protocol, governance, etc.

| Colour | Category |
|--------|----------|
| 🟠 Orange | 🗄️ Hardware |
| 🟤 Brown | 🪪 Physical (non-digital) |
| 🔵 Light Blue | 🚀 Software |
| 🟣 Indigo | 🌐 Network Architecture |
| 🟣 Lavender | 🔗 Protocols |
| 🟢 Green | 📋 Governance / Policy |
| 🩵 Cyan | ☁️ Cloud |
| 🔴 Pink-Red | 🛠️ Technical Methods |
